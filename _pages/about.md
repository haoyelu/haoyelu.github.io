I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the [University of Waterloo](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca) and [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai), supervised by Prof. [Yaoliang Yu](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~y328yu/index.html). Ahead of this, I obtained my Master's degree in Computer Science and Joint Honours Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics from the [University of Ottawa](https://www2.uottawa.ca/en). During my time in Ottawa, I was supervised by Prof. [Amiya Nayak](https://www.site.uottawa.ca/~anayak/) and also worked with Prof. [Yongyi Mao](https://www.site.uottawa.ca/~yymao/) and Prof. [Maia Fraser](https://mysite.science.uottawa.ca/mfrase8/bio.htm). 

I am currently working on theoretical frameworks for training multi-objective reinforcement learning models; however, I also like to dabble in other areas of machine learning.
